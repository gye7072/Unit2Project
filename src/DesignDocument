LinearEquation class
Instance variables:
private int x1 - represents first x coordinate
private int y1 = represents first y coordinate
private int x2 = represents second x coordinate
private int y2 = represents second y coordinate
private int x3 = represents third x coordinate

Constructor
public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
x1 = x1
y1 = y1
x2 = x2
y2 = y2

Methods
public int slopeLine()
calculates slope line

public double calculateDistance()
√((x2 – x1)² + (y2 – y1)²)
calculate distance between two points

public int calculateSlope()
//(x2−x1) (x2 − x1)
calculate slope between two points

public int y-intercept()
calculate y-intercept

public double calculateY()
substitute x3 in slope-intercept to find y

public String calculateLinearEquation()
//slope-intercept (y=(slope)x + y-intercept)
calculate slope


public String toString()
